<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 3em;"><strong><u>Exclusive for new members of  <br> <em>Zach’s Weekly Squawk Box</em>.</u></strong></p>



 <p>Dear John Doe,</p>

<p>Thank you for taking the initiative and joining us today.</p>
<p>In just a few minutes, you’ll receive a confirmation email with everything we’ve promised today.</p>
<p>But first, I have some HUGE news you need to know about…</p>

<p>And the true power of the Income Box…</p>
<p>You’ll want to keep getting this research for the rest of your life.</p>
<p>So I’d like to make sure you have the opportunity to get LIFETIME access to all my Income Box recommendations.</p>
<p>That means every trade I recommend in the <em>Zach’s Weekly Squawk Box</em>…</p>
<p>Not for one year.</p>
<p>Not for two years.</p>
<p>But for life.</p>
<p>Having access for life ensures that you’ll have a chance to collect big retirement paychecks as soon as each window opens…</p>
<p>You could be pocketing $7,484, $16,408… and even $31,026… from a single trade…</p>
<p>For the rest of your life. </p>
<p>We’re calling this upgrade the <em>Zach’s Weekly Squawk Box</em> LIFETIME Upgrade…</p>
<p>It’s a one-time chance we’re offering to charter members to secure uninterrupted access to all the Income Box plays that I recommend!</p>
<p>Save thousands in subscription fees…</p>
<p>And gain access to a number of VIP benefits you can’t get anywhere else.</p>
<p>Here’s how it works…</p>

<h3>With a Simple Click of Your Mouse, You Can Claim a LIFETIME of Access To <em>Zach’s Weekly Squawk Box</em></h3>

<p>Not just one year’s worth.</p>
<p>Not five years’ worth.</p>
<p>But “forever” access…</p>
<p>That’s right – “forever.”</p>
<p>In other words, you’ll have a new trade recommendation delivered to your email box…</p>
<p>A weekly call worth $1,300… </p>
<p>For as long as you like.</p>
<p>Like I showed you today, could have turned $5,000 into a retirement paycheck of over $7,484, $16,408… and even $31,026…</p>
<p>In just days.</p>
<p>Do that each and every week and you’re looking at the chance for EXTRA income of up to $842,868 per year… with little effort!</p>
<p>In five years that’s over $4,214,240!</p>
<p>Can you imagine how having that kind of extra income would change YOUR life?</p>
<p>And you can do that this year…</p>
<p>Next year… </p>
<p>The year after… and every year after that… for as long as you choose.</p>
<p>Powerful and exciting, isn’t it?</p>
<p>Knowing you could have full control of your family’s financial future, without ever worrying about money to fund your dream retirement lifestyle?</p>
<p>Enough money to buy that beach house or sailboat you’ve always dreamed about…</p>
<p>To take that cruise to the French Riviera…</p>
<p>Or to pay for a child’s or grandchild’s college education…</p>
<p>Best of all, because you’re a charter member, I’ve prepared a very special offer for you.</p>
<p>It’s the lowest priced offer we’ll ever charge for a LIFETIME of this research service.</p>
<p>And you can get all this with a single click of your mouse.</p>
<p>No need to enter your credit card information again. </p>
<p>But that’s not all, because as part of this special one-time offer, you also get…</p>
 

<h3>Our “Direct Dial” <br>
Customer Care Plan</h3>

<p>By enrolling in this lifetime upgrade offer today, you also get instant access to our special “Direct Dial” customer care plan.</p>

<p>What’s involved? For one, you’ll get a special hotline phone number you can call anytime.</p>

<p>The number rings direct to your specific liaison on our customer care team.</p> 

<p>No frustrating, automated menus to navigate through. No mind-numbing elevator-style music to wait through.</p>

<p>Because when you join this program today, we’ll give you the phone number that will serve as your personal lifetime liaison number.</p>

<p>And if you have any questions about your subscription or any of the benefits I’m telling you about today…</p>

<p>You can call them whenever you have any questions… from Monday through Friday between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. Eastern!</p>

<p>In fact, when you call, you will ring them on a special phone we’ve set up for our LIFETIME subscribers.</p>

<p>This phone rings right on their desk, and since it has a special ring, they answer it before taking any other calls.</p> 

<p>They will do everything they can to make sure your question is answered and your needs are met to your satisfaction.</p>

<p>Keep in mind we can’t give any personal investing advice (by law) over the phone.</p> 

<p>However, if you have a question about your membership, your lifetime liaison will answer it to the best of their ability.</p>

<p>In fact, since you’ll have Upgrade Service Status, it’s very possible I might even address your question in one of my alerts or calls. (Again, by law I can’t respond personally, or give personalized investment advice either.)</p>

<p>We don’t independently advertise or sell this Direct Dial access at any price.</p>

<p>But you’ll get it today, FREE, just by responding to this offer…</p>

<p>It only takes one simple step to receive all of these incredible benefits.</p>

<p>Here’s how…</p>


<h3>One Click for a Lifetime of
42-Day Retirement Windows</h3>

<p>When you join us today with this offer, you can get Zach’s Weekly Squawk Box for the rest of your life…</p>

<p>Without ever paying another individual subscription fee...</p>

<p>Without ever paying a renewal fee...</p>

<p>And without ever worrying about missing the next Retirement Window play.</p>

<p>Plus, you’ll receive the “Direct Dial” access to our customer care team…</p>

<p>How much is access to a lifetime of the best Income Box plays worth to you?</p>

<p>Before you answer, consider this...</p>

<p>With today’s special membership offer, you’ve paid $2,000 for the first year’s subscription.</p>

<p>That means the second year will cost you $2,000.</p>

<p>The third year, $2,000 more… the fourth, $2,000 more.</p> 

<p>And so on.</p>

<p>That means in the next 10 years you’ll be paying a total $20,000.</p>

<p>Even at that price, it’s well worth it...</p> 

<p>Considering how much you could make from these Income Box plays.</p>

<p>If we charged $10,000 for this one-time “lifetime” upgrade, it would already be a bargain.</p>

<p>However, you’re not going to pay anything close to this amount today…</p>

<p>You won’t pay $7,500...</p> 

<p>Or even $5,000 today.</p>

<p>In fact, I think you’ll be surprised just how affordable this lifetime access is.</p>

<p>But first, there’s one more benefit to tell you about. Something you can only claim today as part of this special offer…</p>


<h3>It’s Called the Legacy Program</h3>

<p>In essence, this program ensures your heirs will continue to benefit from your <em>Zach’s Weekly Squawk Box</em> LIFETIME upgrade long after you’re gone.</p> 

<p>By subscribing to this upgrade today, you’ll be able to pass your membership down to a family member.</p> 

<p>That way you could keep this subscription going throughout generations of your family, starting with your children, grandchildren or immediate heirs.</p> 

<p>There are no transfer fees or charges of any type for your heirs.</p> 

<p>You’ll not only have the tools to build better wealth, but you could reward your family for generations by acting today.</p> 

<p>Just imagine you and your children and your grandchildren collecting big retirement paychecks in the years ahead…</p> 

<p>With that in mind, I’d like to make this deal a “no-brainer.” </p> 

<p>So today... through this message only... you can join for a tiny fraction of what you’d pay in subscriptions over a lifetime...</p> 

<p>You can join right now for just an extra $1,000.</p> 

<p>Remember, the published price for <em>Zach’s Weekly Squawk Box</em> is $4,000 per year.</p> 

<p>And yet, for today’s special charter offer , you could get a LIFETIME of benefits for our YEARLY PUBLISHING price.</p> 

<p>It’s somewhat ridiculous how cheap we’ve made this.</p> 

<p>Again, this is a one-time payment for a lifetime of access.</p> 

<p>There are no renewal fees. No maintenance fees. No hidden charges.</p> 

<p>It’s simple – you pay this extra $1,000 fee once.</p> 

<p>And you’ll instantly secure a lifetime of my <em>Weekly Squawk Box</em>(normally $4,000 per year!).</p> 

<p>One click and you get my research for life, PLUS every hot Income Box trade alert... the Legacy Program… your “Direct Dial” service… and all the rest…</p> 

<p>We’ve never done anything like this.</p> 

<p>And we may never do it again.</p>

<p>And remember – with the research costs of this system and the Samsung tablet, I simply cannot offer any refunds on this special offer.</p>

<p>To upgrade today, simply click the “YES, UPGRADE MY ACCOUNT” button below.</p>

<p>Once you click, we’ll automatically cancel the fee you just paid…</p>

<p>And instead charge your card a total one-time payment of just $4,000.</p>

<p>Then we’ll send you to a page with your LIFETIME login information, and you’ll be good to go.</p>

<p>It’s that simple.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can click “NO, I WANT TO FORFEIT MY CHANCE TO UPGRADE” and we’ll simply take you to the regular <em>Zach’s Weekly Squawk Box</em> confirmation page.</p>

<p>The choice is yours.</p>

<p>Thank you again for subscribing.</p>
