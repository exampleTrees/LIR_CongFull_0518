<p class="start">Hi, I&rsquo;m Zach Scheidt.</p>

<p>In my hands I am holding what I believe to be one of the most powerful investing tools<br class="break-page" />
of all time.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a small black box&hellip;</p>

<p>No bigger than a coffee mug.</p>

<p>But this black box unlocks an incredible secret&hellip;</p>

<p>A secret that can help you pinpoint HUGE moves in the stock market&hellip;</p>

<p>BEFORE they happen.</p>

<p>Giving you the chance to walk away with an average of $16,209 every week!</p>

<p>The tool it&rsquo;s based on is so powerful&hellip;</p>

<p>That it helped me personally make my fund over $8 million in a few<br class="break-800" />
short years&hellip;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll reveal everything in just a moment&hellip;</p>

<p id="gif1Trigger">But for now, all you need to know is this box is so easy to use&hellip;</p>

<p>All you have to do is connect the black box to your computer&hellip;</p>

<p>Open the program&hellip; wait for the broadcast&hellip; then make your move&hellip;</p>
<img class="image_center" id="gif1" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/AF/WSB/WSB_Black-Box_0318/WSB-BlackBox-Novavax-01.png" />
<p>Once you&rsquo;re notified of the information&hellip;</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re in position to place one simple trade&hellip;</p>

<p>Then cash out a few days later&hellip;</p>

<p>&hellip;With a potential fortune!</p>

<p><strong>I&rsquo;m talking about as much as $7,484<br class="break-400" />
in 15 days&hellip; $16,408 in seven days&hellip;<br class="break-page" />
<br class="break-400" />
and even $31,026 in nine days.</strong></p>

<p>Even though most people don&rsquo;t know about the origins of this box, its history dates back<br class="break-page" />
to the early 2000s&hellip;</p>

<p>When my hedge fund was working on a secret project with Wall Street giant Bear Stearns.</p>

<p>The top echelon of the hedge fund industry used a small black box not so different<br class="break-page" />
in appearance from the box I am holding right now.</p>

<p>Since I was one of them, I had one on my desk too.</p>

<p>And every week, the box would send me an urgent alert&hellip; like the one you<br class="break-800" />
just heard.</p>

<p>Telling me about what I call &ldquo;front trades&rdquo;&hellip; or big market moves that allow big players<br class="break-page" />
on Wall Street to spot these big winners&hellip; often BEFORE everyday folks like you.</p>

<p>These front trades are 100% legal and allowed me to find some of the most overlooked opportunities in the market&hellip;</p>

<p>Pretty soon, I was using this black box to generate some of the most lucrative trades<br class="break-page" />
at my hedge fund.</p>

<p>But when Bear Sterns collapsed in 2008&hellip;</p>

<p>The entire project collapsed.</p>

<p>And the tool that helped me personally make over $8 million was erased<br class="break-800" />
from history.</p>

<p>That is&hellip;</p>

<p>Until now.</p>

<h3>Today, I Am Making<br class="break-400" />
the Most Important<br class="break-page" />
Announcement<br class="break-400" />
of My Career</h3>

<p>You see&hellip;</p>

<p>This particular tool was NEVER made available outside the big Wall<br class="break-800" />
Street banks.</p>

<p>If you were not an insider like myself, you were out of luck.</p>

<p>And that really gave Wall Street an unfair advantage over the little guy&hellip;</p>

<p>Because as TheStreet.com says: &ldquo;[The original black box] can be a major advantage<br class="break-page" />
to traders trying to cash in on sudden price movement in a stock.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That rigged game changes today&hellip;</p>

<p>Because as a leading analyst of the &ldquo;black box project&rdquo;&hellip;</p>

<p>I made it my life mission to resurrect the secret behind the most powerful investing tool<br class="break-page" />
in history.</p>

<p>And after a revolutionary decade-long project&hellip;</p>

<p>I am officially announcing the return of the black box&hellip; designed specifically<br class="break-800" />
for everyday folks like you.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll even give away a limited number of black boxes today. Yes, I&rsquo;ll send you your very own black box by certified mail.</p>

<p>Just keep in mind&hellip;</p>

<p>After I left the hedge fund, I was not allowed to take any information about the black box<br class="break-page" />
with me, including its incredible track record.</p>

<p>It was all proprietary data&hellip;</p>

<p>NEVER to be released to what Wall Street insiders call &ldquo;unauthorized persons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So because my new and improved black box has never been made<br class="break-800" />
public before&hellip;</p>

<p>All the trade examples I&rsquo;ll mention today are necessarily drawn from how this could&rsquo;ve performed by analyzing historical data.</p>

<p>And with new technological advancements&hellip;</p>

<h3>This Tool Is So Powerful&hellip;<br class="break-page" />
<br class="break-800" />
<br class="break-639" />
I Am Calling It the Income Box</h3>

<p>As you&rsquo;re about to see, the Income Box strategy could help you pocket<br class="break-800" />
$16,209 every<br class="break-page" />
seven days&hellip;</p>

<p><u>That equates to $842,868 a year.</u></p>

<p>And when you see how easy it is to use&hellip;</p>

<p id="gif2Trigger">You&rsquo;ll never invest the same way again.</p>

<p>For example&hellip;</p>

<p>Take a look at what happened to multibillion-dollar corporation Novavax this past January&hellip;</p>
<img class="image_center" id="gif2" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/AF/WSB/WSB_Black-Box_0318/WSB-BlackBox-Novavax-01.png" />
<p>For the two years prior, Novavax was plummeting in stock price due to a failed FDA test<br class="break-page" />
for their RSV vaccine.</p>

<p>This one promising biotech company lost their best product&hellip; and they weren&rsquo;t making<br class="break-page" />
any money.</p>

<p>Everyone thought this stock was headed for bankruptcy&hellip;</p>

<p id="gif3Trigger">Except the Income Box&hellip;</p>

<p>Which gave the buy signal for January 9&hellip;</p>

<p>Take a look.</p>
<img class="image_center" id="gif3" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/AF/WSB/WSB_Black-Box_0318/WSB-BlackBox-Novavax-02.png" />
<p>That sound you just heard meant big players on Wall Street were trying to get<br class="break-800" />
in before everyday folks on an upcoming big move in Novavax.</p>

<p>Now keep in mind&hellip;</p>

<p>The day the Income Box signaled the buy alert, there wasn&rsquo;t any news regarding Novavax&hellip;</p>

<p>There was nothing out of the ordinary&hellip;</p>

<p>And there weren&rsquo;t any press releases scheduled.</p>

<p>But the Income Box calculated that someone was trying to beat everyday investors<br class="break-page" />
on an upcoming big move&hellip;</p>

<p>And just one day after the Income Box signaled the alert&hellip;</p>

<p>An investment banking company named B. Riley made an EYE-POPPING upgrade<br class="break-page" />
on Novavax.</p>

<p>Simply put&hellip;</p>

<p>The stock EXPLODED.</p>

<p>Investors could have seen a 63% return in a SINGLE day thanks to the<br class="break-800" />
Income Box&hellip;</p>

<p>Most people missed that big move. They were beat because they couldn&rsquo;t spot<br class="break-page" />
the front trade!</p>

<p>And by the time they heard the news, it was already too late to make the biggest profits&hellip;</p>

<p>Because this announcement completely surprised investors.</p>

<p>No one was supposed to know B. Riley was about to upgrade the stock.</p>

<p>But had you used my Income Box strategy, you would have known something big was about to happen&hellip;</p>

<p>And you could have got in BEFORE the report was released.</p>

<p>Allowing you to capture a one-day gain of 63% on a multibillion-dollar health<br class="break-page" />
care company&hellip;</p>

<p>Simply by purchasing their regular stock!</p>

<p>Imagine investing $5,000&hellip;</p>

<p>And walking away with $8,167 in less than 24 hours&hellip;</p>
<img class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/AF/WSB/WSB_Black-Box_0318/WSB-BlackBox-figures-Novavax.png" />
<p>Without risking your money in dangerous options.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s the power of the Income Box strategy&hellip;</p>

<p>It measures when hedge funds have just placed MASSIVE &ldquo;front trades&rdquo;<br class="break-800" />
on stocks&hellip;</p>

<p>Trying to beat everyday investors&hellip; and get in before big moves in the market.</p>

<p>As I&rsquo;ll explain in a moment, these front trades are different from regular trades&hellip;</p>

<p>They&rsquo;re purposely downplayed to the public&hellip; so nobody knows what&rsquo;s<br class="break-800" />
really happening.</p>

<p>But by simply piggybacking them&hellip;</p>

<p>You can profit to the tune of $8,167, $14,711, even $44,850!</p>

<p>And it&rsquo;s so easy&hellip;</p>

<p>All you have to do is place a simple trade when you get my alert&hellip;</p>

<p>And cash out a few weeks later!</p>

<h3>It&rsquo;s the Only Way I Know for<br class="break-800" />
Mom-and-Pop Investors to Turn<br class="break-800" />
the Tables on Wall Street<br class="break-page" />
and Get<br class="break-800" />
Ahead of Big, Unexpected Moves&hellip;<br class="break-800" />
BEFORE They Happen&hellip;</h3>

<p id="gif4Trigger">For example&hellip;</p>

<p>Take a look at what happened on October 27&hellip;</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s when the Income Box gave the buy signal on Whiting Petroleum&hellip;</p>
<img class="image_center" id="gif4" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/AF/WSB/WSB_Black-Box_0318/WSB-BlackBox-Whiting-01.png" />
<p>Nothing was happening that day&hellip;</p>

<p>There wasn&rsquo;t any crazy news regarding Whiting&hellip;</p>

<p>No one was expecting anything&hellip;</p>

<p>In fact&hellip;</p>

<p>This multibillion-dollar oil titan was in a three-year slump ever since OPEC ramped up production in the Middle East&hellip; causing the price of oil to plummet.</p>

<p>And with Whiting&rsquo;s enormous debt load, it seemed like this oil company was on its last legs.</p>

<p>From the news, it looked like everyone was selling their shares&hellip;</p>

<p>HOWEVER&hellip;</p>

<p id="gif5Trigger">The Income Box had a different opinion&hellip;</p>

<p>And on October 23&hellip; the buy signal flashed.</p>

<p>Take a look&hellip;</p>
<img class="image_center" id="gif5" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/AF/WSB/WSB_Black-Box_0318/WSB-BlackBox-Whiting-03.png" />
<p>That little sound meant that someone on Wall Street was trying to get IN FRONT of everyday folks like you.</p>

<p>Then a few days later, on October 25&hellip;</p>

<p>Whiting Petroleum surprised investors by announcing a 78% increase in production in their Denver Basin drilling region.</p>

<p>Had you acted when the Income Box gave me the alert&hellip;</p>

<p>You could have walked away with $7,500&hellip;</p>

<p>In just two weeks!</p>
<img class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/AF/WSB/WSB_Black-Box_0318/WSB-BlackBox-figures-Whiting.png" />
<p>Just by purchasing regular stock!</p>

<p>Again, most regular investors missed the big movement from that trade&hellip;</p>

<p>There was no way for you to know that their production numbers were so high.</p>

<p>And if you had waited for the news&hellip;</p>

<p>You would have missed out on this profit.</p>

<p>But it was like the Income Box strategy could pinpoint something was going<br class="break-800" />
to happen.</p>

<p>And had you just waited for the buy signal&hellip;</p>

<p>And placed one simple trade&hellip;</p>

<p>You could have made a small fortune in just a few short days&hellip;</p>

<p>Without risking your money in options, futures or anything extra risky.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s that easy!</p>

<h3>You&rsquo;re In. You&rsquo;re Out. You&rsquo;re Paid.<br class="break-page" />
Nobody<br class="break-400" />
Will Ever Take What&rsquo;s Yours Again.</h3>

<p>That&rsquo;s how I personally made my fund $8 million from the original black box.</p>

<p>In fact, this tool is so powerful and so reliable that it was even investigated by the SEC<br class="break-page" />
on multiple occasions.</p>

<p>After authorities noticed bigwigs on Wall Street were making millions following this box&hellip;</p>

<p>They thought maybe there was something fishy going on&hellip;</p>

<p>Just like John from AB Watley, who used a similar box to make $650,000&hellip;</p>

<p>Or Warren, who generated &ldquo;$125,000 in gross profits&rdquo; using a similar box&hellip;</p>

<p>And Ralph from Citigroup, who made over $600,000&hellip;</p>

<p>But after months of investigation, they concluded that the system<br class="break-800" />
was 100% legal.</p>

<p>So this is not only 100% legal&hellip;</p>

<p>But it could also be the easiest moneymaking strategy you&rsquo;ve ever seen.</p>

<p>For example, look what happened to a company called Harvard Bioscience&hellip;</p>

<p>This publicly traded company was created by Harvard Medical School.</p>

<p>And backed by Harvard&rsquo;s $35 billion endowment&hellip;</p>

<p>Harvard Bioscience distributes products in over 100 countries around<br class="break-800" />
the world&hellip;</p>

<p>Yet despite their prestigious alma mater, Harvard Bioscience was<br class="break-800" />
in the red each quarter&hellip;</p>

<p>And since 2015, they had lost over 60% of their value.</p>

<p>Investors were selling shares left and right.</p>

<p id="gif6Trigger">But despite all of the downward pressure&hellip;</p>

<p id="gif7Trigger">The Income Box flashed the buy signal on December 26.</p>

<p>Which meant someone was trying to take a position before a big<br class="break-800" />
market move&hellip;</p>
<img class="image_center" id="gif6" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/AF/WSB/WSB_Black-Box_0318/WSB-BlackBox-Harvard-01.png" />
<p>Just a few weeks later, Harvard Bioscience announced the takeover<br class="break-page" />
of Data Sciences International.</p>

<p>The impact was extraordinary&hellip;</p>
<img class="image_center" id="gif7" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/AF/WSB/WSB_Black-Box_0318/WSB-BlackBox-Harvard-02.png" />
<p>And management expected an immediate $24.5 million boost to their revenue.</p>

<p>Had you gotten in on December 26, when the Income Box flashed the buy signal, you could have pocketed $7,698 in just a few weeks.</p>
<img class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/AF/WSB/WSB_Black-Box_0318/WSB-BlackBox-figures-Harvard.png" />
<p>Once again, those who placed these trades walked away with a fortune&hellip;</p>

<p>While everyday folks were left with nothing.</p>

<p>Because unless you worked for Harvard Bioscience, you would have had<br class="break-800" />
no idea that this news was coming.</p>

<p id="gif8Trigger">That&rsquo;s where the Income Box strategy comes in&hellip;</p>

<h3>All You Had to Do for the Chance<br class="break-800" />
<br class="break-639" />
to Profit Was&hellip;<br class="break-page" />
Wait for the Buy Signal&hellip; Purchase Regular Shares&hellip; Then Cash Out<br class="break-800" />
<br class="break-400" />
a Few Days Later!</h3>

<p>Just check out this chart from Valeant Pharmaceuticals, one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world.</p>
<img class="image_center" id="gif8" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/AF/WSB/WSB_Black-Box_0318/WSB-BlackBox-Valeant.png" />
<p>Had you used the Income Box&hellip; you could have turned a modest<br class="break-800" />
$5,000 investment<br class="break-page" />
into $8,582&hellip;</p>

<p>Simply by placing a bet on November 16&hellip;</p>

<p>And cashing out a few weeks later.</p>

<p id="gif9Trigger">That&rsquo;s a 72% return&hellip;</p>

<p>From one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world!</p>

<p>Same thing for Weed Inc., the first publicly traded marijuana company<br class="break-800" />
in the U.S.</p>
<img class="image_center" id="gif9" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/AF/WSB/WSB_Black-Box_0318/WSB-BlackBox-Weed.png" />
<p>You could have placed a $5,000 bet on December 19, when the Income Box signaled<br class="break-page" />
the buy&hellip;</p>

<p>And you could have walked away with $27,941 on January 9!</p>
<img class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/AF/WSB/WSB_Black-Box_0318/WSB-BlackBox-figures-Weed.png" />
<p>That&rsquo;s a 459% return&hellip;</p>

<p>Just by receiving a buy alert, placing one simple trade&hellip;</p>

<p>Then cashing out a few weeks later!</p>

<p>Do you now see how powerful this strategy is?</p>

<p>Do you see why hedge funds and the big banks on Wall Street never wanted<br class="break-800" />
it to leave<br class="break-page" />
their offices?</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s really not fair this tool was unknown to everyday folks like you for so long&hellip;</p>

<p>Because this strategy allows you to pocket an average of $16,209 every<br class="break-800" />
seven days&hellip;</p>

<p><u>That equates to $842,868 a year.</u></p>

<p>Enough money to finally buy that beach home in Florida&hellip;</p>

<p>Or get that new Corvette convertible that&rsquo;s always caught your eye&hellip;</p>

<p>Or pay off all your debts.</p>

<p>But since these are short-term plays&hellip;</p>

<p>You don&rsquo;t tie up your money in the market long term.</p>

<p>Which means you not only have the chance to make HUGE capital gains&hellip;</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re also cutting your risk.</p>

<p>Not to mention you&rsquo;re simply buying regular shares, instead of risking your money with dangerous options.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s my favorite part of this strategy.</p>

<p>You can see HUGE gains simply by buying regular stock!</p>

<p>Like all investments, these recommendations may not all be winners, and they<br class="break-page" />
do carry risk&hellip;</p>

<p>But the risk is MUCH smaller than if you were to purchase options that can easily lose<br class="break-page" />
100% of their value.</p>

<p>And of course it depends on how much you put in&hellip;</p>

<p>But that means you can take advantage of this strategy for under $50&hellip;</p>

<p>Isn&rsquo;t that incredible?</p>

<p>And let me tell you this&hellip;</p>

<h3>If You&rsquo;ve Missed Out on These Big Moves<br class="break-800" />
<br class="break-639" />
in the Past, It&rsquo;s Not Your Fault&hellip;</h3>

<p>Most people are in the dark when it comes to these huge front trades&hellip;</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s because they don&rsquo;t typically happen in the open market&hellip;</p>

<p>Not the NYSE&hellip; Nasdaq&hellip; or even OTC&hellip;</p>

<p>As you can probably imagine, these people don&rsquo;t want anyone to know they&rsquo;re making<br class="break-page" />
big moves.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why these trades happen in something called dark pools.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll explain more about dark pools in a minute&hellip;</p>

<p>But without the Income Box strategy&hellip;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s impossible for the little guy to know when these trades happen&hellip;</p>

<p>And you&rsquo;re unlikely to catch the big, unexpected moves that happen<br class="break-800" />
in the weeks following the front trade.</p>

<p>What I mean is&hellip;</p>

<p>You only know about the big stock market moves AFTER they already<br class="break-800" />
take place.</p>

<p>And at that rate&hellip;</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll never make money if you are always a step behind.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why my Income Box has completely revolutionized the investing game.</p>

<p>This is a brand-new way of making money&hellip;</p>

<p>Where you can get in BEFORE big stock moves.</p>

<p>Not after all of the insiders have made their money by getting in before YOU&hellip;</p>

<p>To my knowledge&hellip;</p>

<p>This is <u>the only</u> way for mom-and-pop investors to get ahead of Wall Street.</p>

<p>Because I am sure you have always suspected it&hellip;</p>

<p>But it&rsquo;s easy to forget that&hellip;</p>

<h3>The Wall Street Game<br class="break-400" />
Is Rigged<br class="break-page" />
<br class="break-800" />
<br class="break-639" />
Against People Like You</h3>

<p>Look, in the hedge fund community, the 1% of the 1% are closely knit&hellip;</p>

<p>Where corporate executives and billion-dollar money managers schmooze over vintage wine in prestigious clubs&hellip;</p>

<p>Anything is talked about in a place where cellphones are prohibited&hellip;</p>

<p>And Ferraris are rented out &ldquo;gratis&rdquo; for members.</p>

<p>Oftentimes&hellip;</p>

<p>Information that hasn&rsquo;t reached the public &ldquo;slips&rdquo;&hellip;</p>

<p>Because let&rsquo;s be honest&hellip;</p>

<p>Even if you&rsquo;ve got a billion dollars to deploy&hellip;</p>

<p>A few drinks still gets people talking&hellip;</p>

<p>And information regarding analyst upgrades&hellip;</p>

<p>Takeover deals&hellip;</p>

<p>New product releases&hellip;</p>

<p>Even news regarding mergers and acquisitions tends to flow freely.</p>

<p>And even though this information is &ldquo;secret&rdquo;&hellip;</p>

<p>Hedge funds often use it to their advantage&hellip;</p>

<p>And they try to get in front of the market move by placing those front trades&hellip;</p>

<p>Profiting from events that are seemingly unknown to the average investor.</p>

<p>Because unless you&rsquo;re in the inner circle, you&rsquo;ll miss making money<br class="break-800" />
on those events.</p>

<p>Put simply&hellip;</p>

<p>Hardworking Americans like you have <u>no chance</u> of making real profits<br class="break-800" />
in the stock market.</p>

<p>Does that seem fair to you?</p>

<p>Of course not!</p>

<h3>But Today, I Am Going<br class="break-400" />
to Reveal<br class="break-639" />
How My Income Box Finally Levels the Playing Field Against the Wall Street Elite</h3>

<p>As I mentioned before, my name is Zachary Scheidt.</p>

<p>I spent my career as a multimillion-dollar hedge fund manager in Atlanta&hellip;</p>

<p>Where I saw the ins and outs of HUGE money flows to the tune of billions.</p>

<p>And it was at that hedge fund where I saw how the system was rigged for the wealthy elite&hellip;</p>

<p>It all started in the year 2000&hellip;</p>

<p>When the internet was rapidly expanding&hellip;</p>

<p>And my hedge fund, along with Bear Stearns, was testing a device that would revolutionize the investing game for the ultra-wealthy&hellip;</p>

<p>It was called the squawk box.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Squawk boxes&rdquo; are devices that broadcast, within a securities firm, institutional orders to buy and sell large blocks of securities.</p>

<p>They also send exclusive information from leading analysts across<br class="break-800" />
every industry.</p>

<p>And every week&hellip;</p>

<p>The squawk box would send me information&hellip;</p>

<p>Which I could use to determine where huge trades were being made&hellip;</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s not easy to do.</p>

<p>As you can probably imagine, the big dogs on Wall Street do not place trades like you<br class="break-page" />
and me.</p>

<p>They&rsquo;re not playing with thousands or even hundreds of thousands of dollars.</p>

<p>They&rsquo;re playing with millions and even billions in each single trade.</p>

<p>Because of their massive size, these kinds of trades on not placed on your typical exchange such as the NYSE or NASDAQ.</p>

<p>These types of trades are often placed in a different market&hellip;</p>

<p>In a place called dark pools.</p>

<p>Dark pools are a series of special exchanges and software that institutions and hedge funds build for low transparency.</p>

<p>The thing is&hellip;</p>

<p>Hardly anyone knows the inner workings of dark pools&hellip; and it&rsquo;s a place where hedge funds can place their trades for the global elite&hellip;</p>

<p>As The New York Times reported: &ldquo;While dark trading can benefit some insiders, it may cost the general public as a whole.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Does that sound fair to you?</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s what made the squawk box so powerful&hellip;</p>

<p>It explicitly told us when those trades were happening&hellip;</p>

<p>So we knew exactly how the so-called smart money was betting their money.</p>

<p>And that allowed people to get in trades before BIG, unexpected moves&hellip;</p>

<p>And walk away with a fortune&hellip;</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why The New York Times reported: &ldquo;Order information transmitted over the squawk boxes was sensitive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yes, it was sensitive, because it virtually guaranteed you&rsquo;d walk away with<br class="break-800" />
easy money.</p>

<h3 id="gif10Trigger">Because When You Follow<br class="break-639" />
These Front Trades&hellip;<br class="break-page" />
You Can Make<br class="break-639" />
a Fortune<br class="break-800" />
at Lightning Speed</h3>

<p>Just look at what happened to Atara Biotherapeutics this past December&hellip;</p>

<p>On December 8&hellip; the Income Box flashed the buy signal&hellip;</p>
<img class="image_center" id="gif10" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/AF/WSB/WSB_Black-Box_0318/WSB-BlackBox-Atara-01.png" />
<p>But at that time&hellip; nothing was happening to this multibillion-dollar<br class="break-800" />
biotech company&hellip;</p>

<p>In fact&hellip;</p>

<p>Atara Biotherapeutics was behind schedule on their CAR-T cancer drug&hellip;</p>

<p>And it looked like other pharma giants had already conquered that niche.</p>

<p>From publicly available information, this company looked like a certified sell.</p>

<p>However, the Income Box signaled some big player on Wall Street had just made a huge front trade.</p>

<p id="gif11Trigger">And on December 29&hellip; just a few weeks later&hellip;</p>

<p>Atara announced that the FDA gave the green light for Phase 3 testing.</p>

<p>Shares skyrocketed&hellip;</p>
<img class="image_center" id="gif11" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/AF/WSB/WSB_Black-Box_0318/WSB-BlackBox-Atara-02.png" />
<p>And unless you worked for Atara or the FDA&hellip; you would have had no idea this announcement was coming&hellip;</p>

<p>And you wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to get in front of the movement.</p>

<p>But if you had used the Income Box strategy&hellip;</p>

<p>You would have walked away with $14,711 a few weeks later!</p>
<img class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/AF/WSB/WSB_Black-Box_0318/WSB-BlackBox-figures-Atara.png" />
<p>Again, using this strategy&hellip;</p>

<p>All you had to do was receive the buy alert&hellip;</p>

<p>Place one simple trade&hellip;</p>

<p>Then score a quick 194% gain&hellip;</p>

<p>Just a few weeks later!</p>

<p>And just by purchasing regular shares!</p>

<p id="gif12Trigger">That&rsquo;s incredible, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s another example from my research&hellip;</p>

<p>On January 3, the Income Box gave the buy signal on U.S. Nuclear Corp.</p>
<img class="image_center" id="gif12" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/AF/WSB/WSB_Black-Box_0318/WSB-BlackBox-Nuclear-01.png" />
<p>This Los Angeles-based nuclear company is a worldwide leader<br class="break-800" />
in radiation detection&hellip;</p>

<p>But when the Income Box signaled the buy on January 3&hellip;</p>

<p>Nothing out of the ordinary was happening for this company&hellip;</p>

<p>There were no earnings reports&hellip;</p>

<p>No big press releases scheduled&hellip;</p>

<p>Nothing!</p>

<p id="gif13Trigger">But later that month&hellip;</p>

<p>A report was released that U.S. Nuclear Corp. was partnering with Fusion Power Leader to become a supplier in the $10 billion radioisotope market.</p>

<p>Shares went skyrocketing&hellip;</p>
<img class="image_center" id="gif13" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/AF/WSB/WSB_Black-Box_0318/WSB-BlackBox-Nuclear-02.png" />
<p>And had you bought shares before the event&hellip;</p>

<p>You would have made $44,850&hellip;</p>

<p>In less than a month!</p>
<img class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/AF/WSB/WSB_Black-Box_0318/WSB-BlackBox-figures-Nuclear.png" />
<p>That&rsquo;s a 797% return&hellip; just by purchasing regular stock!</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s so easy.</p>

<p>Wait for the alert&hellip;</p>

<p>Place one simple trade&hellip;</p>

<p>Then profit!</p>

<p>Imagine making more than 40 grand&hellip; in just a month.</p>

<p>Do that once a month, and you&rsquo;re looking at an extra annual income of more than half a million dollars!</p>

<p>And while that would be an exceptional year&hellip; imagine just making half of that.</p>

<p>How would an extra $250,000 change your life?</p>

<p>Would you get a new Mercedes or new boat?</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s scary how much the Income Box strategy could help you make&hellip;</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s another example&hellip;</p>

<p id="gif14Trigger">Just after Christmas, the Income Box signaled it was time to buy<br class="break-800" />
on December 26.</p>

<p>It said that Ares Management, one of the largest private equity firms<br class="break-800" />
in the world&hellip;</p>

<p>Was a screaming buy&hellip;</p>
<img class="image_center" id="gif14" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/AF/WSB/WSB_Black-Box_0318/WSB-BlackBox-Ares-01.png" />
<p>But the thing is&hellip;</p>

<p>For the past year&hellip; this multibillion-dollar firm had actually lost 20% of their value&hellip;<br class="break-page" />
even though the stock market had been crushing record after record.</p>

<p>It looked like this company was going nowhere&hellip;</p>

<p>But the Income Box signaled some players on Wall Street were trying to legally get<br class="break-page" />
IN FRONT of a big market move&hellip;</p>

<p id="gif15Trigger">And on January 4&hellip;</p>

<p>Ares Management announced a massive $139 million sale of a Florida<br class="break-page" />
retirement community.</p>

<p>Paired with the newly implemented tax bill&hellip; shares exploded.</p>
<img class="image_center" id="gif15" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/AF/WSB/WSB_Black-Box_0318/WSB-BlackBox-Ares-02.png" />
<p>Giving you the chance to make $6,641 in a few weeks&hellip;</p>

<p>From a company with $100 BILLION under management!</p>

<p>Again&hellip; all you had to do was use the Income Box strategy&hellip;</p>

<p>Place one simple trade&hellip;</p>

<p>And cash out with a potential fortune just a few weeks later!</p>

<h3 id="gif16Trigger">Sometimes the Gains Happen<br class="break-page" />
<br class="break-800" />
<br class="break-639" />
in a Matter<br class="break-400" />

<p id="gif17Trigger">Take a look at what happened on February 8, 2017.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s when the Income Box pinpointed Zion Oil &amp; Gas as a buy.</p>
<img class="image_center" id="gif16" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/AF/WSB/WSB_Black-Box_0318/WSB-BlackBox-Zion-01.png" />
<p>Just five days later, on February 13&hellip;</p>

<p>Zion Oil &amp; Gas made an announcement that they had recently made<br class="break-page" />
a HUGE oil discovery&hellip;</p>

<p>Their market cap nearly DOUBLED&hellip;</p>

<p>Giving you the chance to make $10,852 in just six days!</p>
<img class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/AF/WSB/WSB_Black-Box_0318/WSB-BlackBox-figures-Zion.png" />
<p>Imagine if you have that kind of extra weekly income?</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s enough for a new mortgage payment with just a week&rsquo;s worth of work.</p>

<h3>Imagine Buying a Stock&hellip;<br class="break-800" />
<br class="break-639" />
and Never Having<br class="break-page" />
to Worry About<br class="break-800" />
if You Bought at the Wrong Time</h3>

<p>Remember the last time you bought a stock that you thought was a good idea&hellip;</p>

<p>You did your due diligence&hellip; and had every reason to believe the stock was gonna<br class="break-page" />
go higher.</p>

<p>And yet, shares dropped by 20% or more just a few days later.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve all been through that. It&rsquo;s infuriating!</p>

<p>Do you frequently wonder if you&rsquo;ve purchased stock at the wrong time?</p>

<p>Well, now you no longer have to worry about that.</p>

<p>My Income Box strategy helps you see when the right time to buy is.</p>

<p>You don&rsquo;t have to worry about &ldquo;catching the top of the market&rdquo;&hellip;</p>

<p>Or missing the big moves that happen out of the blue&hellip;</p>

<p>Instead of constantly being beat by Wall Street insiders&hellip;</p>

<p>The little guy finally has a chance to profit from these big one-day moves&hellip;</p>

<p>Moves that have been making insiders rich for years&hellip;</p>

<h3>Evidence From Harvard Law School Shows:<br class="break-400" />
Hedge Funds Have<br class="break-400" />
a Clear Advantage<br class="break-page" />
Over<br class="break-400" />
the Little Guy</h3>

<p>You see, we&rsquo;ve all suspected that Wall Street was rigged against<br class="break-800" />
everyday investors.</p>

<p>But it&rsquo;s worse than we thought&hellip;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve seen the stories about billionaire Stephen A. Cohen&hellip;</p>

<p>Whose hedge fund made their notorious money on &ldquo;short term&rdquo; plays&hellip;</p>

<p>Such as when Cohen&rsquo;s firm decided to sell their Dell shares shortly before<br class="break-page" />
an earnings miss&hellip;</p>

<p>Cohen probably knew something most investors didn&rsquo;t know&hellip;</p>

<p>And was able to save his firm $1.7 million from a seemingly &ldquo;surprising&rdquo; earnings miss.</p>

<p>Or I&rsquo;m sure you saw when billionaire Leon Cooperman made $4 million placing trades before Atlas Pipeline partners announced the sale of a natural gas plan for $682 million&hellip;</p>

<p>Cooperman was one of Atlas&rsquo; biggest shareholder&hellip; and had frequent meetings<br class="break-page" />
with executives&hellip;</p>

<p>And was still able to profit from an event that no one was supposed to know was coming!</p>

<p>Does that seem fair that Cooperman was able to spot this movement<br class="break-800" />
before you?</p>

<p>Absolutely not!</p>

<p>And now&hellip; hedge funds are getting away with even MORE.</p>

<p>A recent Harvard Law School report showed that hedge funds are now getting information from political lobbyists:</p>

<p>&ldquo;By hiring lobbyists, hedge fund managers can gain access to information about ongoing or impending government actions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Harvard&rsquo;s research even included this tidbit:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>As an example&hellip; consider the case of USG. Corp.<br class="break-page" />
  <br class="break-800" />
  A building-material company facing an estimated<br class="break-800" />
  $5.5 billion<br class="break-page" />
  in asbestos-related lawsuits.</em></li>
  <li><em>On November 15, the company&rsquo;s stock was traded<br class="break-800" />
  at 200% the normal volume&hellip; and delivered an abnormal return of 5%&hellip;<br class="break-page" />
  Yet no company specific news was delivered that day.</em></li>
  <li><em>The following day, the Senate majority leader announced a plan<br class="break-page" />
  to create a $140 billion bailout fund to relieve companies such<br class="break-page" />
  as USG of their asbestos liabilities.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>In conclusion, the Harvard research report stated:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It appears the market reacted before the public announcement.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Doesn&rsquo;t that make you sick?</p>

<p>We all knew that hedge fund managers had the upper hand.</p>

<p>But this is getting out of hand.</p>

<h3>Today, the Rigged<br class="break-400" />
Game Ends</h3>

<p>Look, they&rsquo;re not going stop beating everyday folks like you to these plays&hellip;</p>

<p>All you can do is beat them at their own game&hellip;</p>

<p>By using the Income Box strategy.</p>

<p>The only way to catch these big, unexpected moves is by following hedge funds and their activity in dark pools.</p>

<p>Think about it&hellip;</p>

<p>If there&rsquo;s no news about a specific company&hellip;</p>

<p>And hedge funds are placing unusually large bets&hellip;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s very likely that they know something we don&rsquo;t, right?</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s very likely they&rsquo;re trying to get IN FRONT of the market move.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s what the Income Box sets out to determine&hellip;</p>

<p id="gif18Trigger">It uses a proprietary algorithm to track big front trades placed by hedge funds&hellip;</p>

<p>In real time.</p>

<p>So let me pull back the curtain and show you what&rsquo;s actually behind the Income<br class="break-page" />
Box strategy&hellip;</p>
<img class="image_center" id="gif18" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/AF/WSB/WSB_Black-Box_0318/WSB-BlackBox-Whiting-03.png" /> <img class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/AF/WSB/WSB_Black-Box_0318/WSB-Black-Box_trade-initiated2.png" />
<p>Take the Whiting Petroleum example from October 23&hellip;</p>

<p>See that big spike?</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s the algorithm picking up on big money flows&hellip;</p>

<p>Put simply&hellip;</p>

<p>It measures how much money is flowing in and out of the stock by observing the trades<br class="break-page" />
in each stock.</p>

<p>And when the algorithm &ldquo;spikes&rdquo;&hellip;</p>

<p>That means hedge funds are potentially placing big money trades.</p>

<p>In the case of Whiting Petroleum, for example, when the Income Box algorithm indicated<br class="break-page" />
it was time to make a move&hellip;</p>

<p>There was $1,977,075,240 flowing into that stock.</p>

<p>To put that into perspective, that&rsquo;s 13 times HIGHER than the normal amount of money<br class="break-page" />
that flows into that stock on a typical day.</p>

<p>Here is the formula behind the spike:</p>
<img class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/AF/WSB/WSB_Black-Box_0318/WSB-BlackBox_equation.png" />
<p>It measures the volume-weighted average of accumulation and distribution over the<br class="break-page" />
last 20 days.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s how it picks up when a front trade is happening.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t let the complexity scare you&hellip;</p>

<p>The tools behind the Income Box do all of the calculations.</p>

<p>All you need to know is this.</p>

<p><strong>When the Income Box sees big money flow to a certain degree&hellip;</strong></p>

<p><strong>It means that hedge funds or someone in the know is trying to get IN FRONT of big market moves.</strong></p>

<p>And its calculations will indicate that a front trade has been placed.</p>

<p>Just like what happened in Whiting Petroleum&hellip;</p>
<img class="image_center" id="gif14" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/AF/WSB/WSB_Black-Box_0318/WSB-BlackBox-Whiting-03.png" />
<p>The algorithm would have picked up on investors making their move&hellip;</p>

<p>And I would have known a full 15 days ahead of time to get in BEFORE<br class="break-page" />
the profit explosion&hellip;</p>

<p>Giving you the chance to make a quick 50% profit from investors trying to rig<br class="break-800" />
the game!</p>

<p>Isn&rsquo;t that incredible?</p>

<p>The beauty of the Income Box strategy is that it calculates everything for you&hellip;</p>

<p>You don&rsquo;t have to look at screens or those scary-looking indicators that don&rsquo;t work half<br class="break-page" />
the time&hellip;</p>

<p>You can use my Income Box strategy to determine when to make a trade&hellip;</p>

<p>Because that means hedge funds are making heavy bets&hellip;</p>

<p>Which can notify you about big stock market moves BEFORE they happen.</p>

<p>Just take a look at what happened to Crown Baus Capital&hellip;</p>

<h3 id="gif19Trigger">Imagine Making $34,950 in Less Than Two Weeks<br class="break-page" />
From the Blockchain Craze&hellip; WITHOUT Buying<br class="break-page" />
Any Risky Cryptos&hellip;</h3>

<p>On January 3, there was no significant news regarding Crown Baus Capital.</p>

<p>But the algorithm behind the Income Box said that hedge funds were taking<br class="break-page" />
<br class="break-800" />
a potential stake.</p>
<img class="image_center" id="gif19" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/AF/WSB/WSB_Black-Box_0318/WSB-BlackBox-Crown-01.png" />
<p>Simply put&hellip;</p>

<p>All this unusual money flow indicated someone was trying to profit from a big,<br class="break-page" />
unexpected move.</p>

<p id="gif20Trigger">In fact, the money flow was 44 times higher during this time&hellip;</p>

<p>On January 16&hellip;</p>

<p>It was announced that Crown Baus acquired a military-grade cryptographic secure online communications system&hellip;</p>
<img class="image_center" id="gif20" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/AF/WSB/WSB_Black-Box_0318/WSB-BlackBox-Crown-02.png" />
<p>In order to revolutionize and bring military-grade, blockchain cybersecurity<br class="break-800" />
to the<br class="break-page" />
everyday consumer.</p>

<p>Now did someone know that this announcement was coming?</p>

<p>Of course they did!</p>

<p>The Income Box picked up massive money flowing into the stock right before the announcement.</p>

<p>And had you gotten in when the Income Box identified those front trades&hellip;</p>

<p>You could have walked away with $34,950&hellip; in just two weeks!</p>
<img class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/AF/WSB/WSB_Black-Box_0318/WSB-BlackBox-figures-Crown.png" />
<p>Do you now see how the Income Box strategy can help you level the<br class="break-800" />
playing field?</p>

<p>You have the chance to get in BEFORE big, unexpected news&hellip;</p>

<p>And you can walk away with a fortune&hellip;</p>

<p>In a matter of days!</p>

<p>Just look at what happened in Recall Studios this past January.</p>

<p>On January 10, there was nothing going on in Recall Studios.</p>

<p id="gif21Trigger">No press releases&hellip; Nothing&hellip;</p>

<p id="gif22Trigger">But the algorithm behind the Income Box picked up unusual activity.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s time you get in before everyone else.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s no time to waste&hellip;</p>

<p>To help you get started&hellip;</p>

<p>That why I&rsquo;m limiting the number of readers to 1,000 today.</p>

<p>Today we are opening the door to 1,000 new members.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s how this brand-new research service works&hellip;</p>

<p>STEP 1: Every week&hellip; I will be using my Income Box to identify dark pool trades and unusual hedge fund activity across the U.S. market.</p>

<p>STEP 2: As soon as my system indicates lucrative activity&hellip; I&rsquo;ll do my own analysis of the company&hellip; and I&rsquo;ll find the one that could hand you the<br class="break-800" />
biggest gain.</p>

<p>STEP 3: Finally, I&rsquo;ll send you an email&hellip; with exact instructions on how<br class="break-800" />
to profit&hellip; the exact setup, what trade to make and when to take profits.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll only make our research and recommendations available to members<br class="break-800" />
of <strong><em>Zach&rsquo;s Weekly Squawk Box.</em></strong></p>

<p>And to help you get started&hellip;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll also send you a FREE handbook called <strong><em>The Income Box<br class="break-800" />
Investing Handbook.</em></strong></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s an easy 20-minute read. Inside, you&rsquo;ll find&hellip;</p>

<ul class="checkmark">

<ul class="checkmark">

<img class="image_center email" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/AF/WSB/WSB_Black-Box_0318/WSB-BlackBox_email.png" />
<p>Remember, the Income Box just pinpointed an opportunity for this company.</p>

<p>Do hedge funds know something big is about to be announced?</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s time to jump in&hellip; before any potential news hits the public.</p>

<p>This secure link will give you all of the details.</p>

<p>Everything I&rsquo;ve mentioned so far is yours FREE&hellip; as soon as you join <strong><em>Zach&rsquo;s Weekly Squawk Box.</em></strong></p>

<p>As far as I know, this is the only tool in the entire world that can track these big<br class="break-page" />
market moves&hellip;</p>

<p>The only tool that can help you get ahead of big moves&hellip; giving you<br class="break-800" />
the chance to&hellip;</p>

<h3>Make $14,711, $27,941<br class="break-400" />
and $61,642<br class="break-page" />
<br class="break-800" />
<br class="break-639" />
in a Matter<br class="break-400" />
of DAYS</h3>

<p>How much would that be worth to you?</p>

<p>Before you answer, consider this&hellip;</p>

<p>When I used to run a hedge fund&hellip;</p>

<p>We used to charge something called the 2-and-20 fee structure&hellip;</p>

<p>Meaning you are charged a 2% management fee&hellip;</p>

<p>AND you give the fund 20% of your returns.</p>

<p>Remember how I said the Income Box strategy proved it can yield average returns totaling $16,209 per week?</p>

<p>That equates to $842,868 a year&hellip;</p>

<p>With gains like that&hellip;</p>

<p>Your fees would easily be over $168,000.</p>

<p>And to be fair&hellip;</p>

<p>With returns like that&hellip;</p>

<p>I think that&rsquo;s worth every penny&hellip;</p>

<p>But don&rsquo;t worry.</p>

<p>The special membership to <strong><em>Zach&rsquo;s Weekly Squawk Box</em></strong> won&rsquo;t cost anywhere<br class="break-page" />
near $168,000.</p>

<p>It won&rsquo;t even cost $50,000.</p>

<p>Not even $10,000&hellip;</p>

<p>Because I&rsquo;m not running a hedge fund for rich people anymore. I just want to help level the playing field.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll give you all of the details on the offer in a just a moment&hellip;</p>

<p>But first, I&rsquo;d understand you might have some questions about our strategy.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve tried to compile the most common ones. Let me answer them right now.</p>

<h4>Question: Is there some kind of trick<br class="break-400" />
in the math on these positions? Do you really not use options, which other services love to use?</h4>

<h4 class="green">Answer: No. The Income Box does<br class="break-400" />
NOT use options, futures<br class="break-page" />
or fancy derivatives&hellip;</h4>

<p>You see&hellip;</p>

<p>A lot of trading services these days like to tout big gains&hellip;</p>

<p>But the only way they can achieve those gains is by purchasing options.</p>

<p>Now, if you&rsquo;ve been following me for a while&hellip;</p>

<p>You know I am not a fan of buying options&hellip;</p>

<p>After all, research shows that most options expire worthless.</p>

<p>In other words, most people who are buying options are losing 100% of<br class="break-800" />
their investment.</p>

<p>In fact, with options you can lose all your money in a DAY&hellip;</p>

<p>And no one can sleep easy knowing that their investment can be completely worthless with a small drop in stock price&hellip;</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why the Income Box is so perfect for folks who don&rsquo;t want to risk their hard-earned money in complicated options or derivatives&hellip;</p>

<p>You see&hellip;</p>

<p>With my strategy, those big gains are possible simply by purchasing<br class="break-800" />
regular stock.</p>

<p>Yes, $5,000 turned into $27,941 in 21 days&hellip;</p>

<p>$44,850 in 13 days&hellip;</p>

<p>And $61,642 in 14 days&hellip; just with regular shares!</p>

<p>All you have to do is wait for the Income Box to indicate a big move&hellip;</p>

<p>Decide to place one simple trade&hellip;</p>

<p>And then cash out with a potential fortune!</p>

<p>But if this strategy is so profitable, you might be wondering&hellip;</p>

<h4>Question: If this system is so profitable&hellip; why don&rsquo;t you keep<br class="break-page" />
<br class="break-400" />
it for yourself?</h4>

<h4 class="green">Answer: I already made $8 million<br class="break-400" />
using this strategy.<br class="break-800" />
Now I want<br class="break-page" />
to share that secret.</h4>

<p>I&rsquo;ve already made a more than enough money to support myself using<br class="break-800" />
this strategy&hellip;</p>

<p>And now I want to help ordinary folks who don&rsquo;t have access to the wealth-building strategies of the global elite.</p>

<p>It always irked me that the machine was rigged to make the rich get richer.</p>

<p>And after my kids were born (I&rsquo;ve got seven!)&hellip; I saw what life was really about.</p>

<p>Being happy.</p>

<p>Enjoying time with my family.</p>

<p>And doing something more fulfilling than helping the rich get richer.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m on a mission to make the Income Box available to everyday folks like you.</p>

<p>Imagine&hellip; what would you do with an extra $16,209 a week?</p>

<p>Maybe you would buy a new vacation home in Florida&hellip;</p>

<p>Or buy the fishing boat you&rsquo;ve always wanted&hellip;</p>

<p>Maybe you&rsquo;d just pay off your debts and have enough to buy the grandkids nicer presents&hellip;</p>

<p>Whatever your goal is&hellip;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s possible with the help of Zach&rsquo;s Weekly Squawk Box.</p>

<h4>Question: Do I have to watch my computer screen or wait<br class="break-800" />
by the<br class="break-400" />
Income Box for the trade recommendation all day?</h4>

<h4 class="green">Answer: No. This strategy is meant<br class="break-400" />
for people who are<br class="break-800" />
&ldquo;on the go.&rdquo;</h4>

<p>Like I&rsquo;ve said many times&hellip;</p>

<p>This strategy is built for ease.</p>

<p>Since we are always on our phones&hellip;</p>

<p>And not necessarily at a computer&hellip;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll even send you a convenient text telling you a new recommendation has hit your inbox.</p>

<p>With current technology, placing a trade on your smartphone or tablet has never been easier.</p>

<p>And that means you can trade whether you are at the grocery store or gardening in the backyard!</p>

<p>So here is why I&rsquo;d like to do something a little different&hellip;</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re one of the lucky 1,000 to join me today&hellip; I&rsquo;ll also send you three special gifts.</p>

<h3>Bonus #1: Send Me Your Phone Number&hellip;<br class="break-page" />
and I Will Call You Every Week</h3>

<p>One thing I hate about newsletters is that so-called &ldquo;gurus&rdquo; don&rsquo;t have enough contact with their members.</p>

<p>So I would like to do something special&hellip;</p>

<p>And host an hourlong call every week.</p>

<p>You see, I want to chat every time the Income Box indicates a new trade alert&hellip;</p>

<p>Each week you&rsquo;ll receive my newest recommendation report, and during the call we&rsquo;ll go over the new pick&hellip; and all of the latest market news you need<br class="break-800" />
to know&hellip;</p>

<p>Giving you a FULL rundown of the opportunity we are taking advantage of.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll be discussing the most recent trade recommendations and analysis from earlier that morning, on top of answering your most pressing questions,<br class="break-800" />
in LIVE calls.</p>

<p>This one&rsquo;s a real game changer. And it&rsquo;s exactly the same type of &ldquo;inside&rdquo; insight that professional traders use to make big gains.</p>

<p>The same kind of service that some people pay $1,300 PER HOUR for&hellip;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll send you a link to a webinar where we can chat&hellip;</p>

<p>And you can ask LIVE questions in the chat box.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s correct.</p>

<p>No other research service gets you an up-close-and-personal webinar like this!</p>

<p>Of course, other members will be on the webinar as well.</p>

<p>But your questions pop up LIVE on the call.</p>

<p>And I can answer them immediately!</p>

<p>Now we can&rsquo;t give any personalized investment advice, but pretty much every other pressing market concern is up for grabs!</p>

<p>My clients at the hedge fund would have had to pay a massive amount for these phone calls&hellip;</p>

<p>And similar services cost up to $1,300 PER CALL&hellip;</p>

<p>But as a charter member of <strong><em>Zach&rsquo;s Weekly Squawk Box&hellip;</em></strong></p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll get these weekly calls absolutely free.</p>

<p>And I&rsquo;ll give you the notice when the Income Box alerts me<br class="break-800" />
of a trade opportunity.</p>

<h3>Bonus #2: I&rsquo;ll FedEx You Your Own<br class="break-page" />
PERSONAL Black Box</h3>
<img class="image_center box" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/AF/WSB/WSB_Black-Box_0318/WSB-BlackBox_bbox2.png" />
<p>I told you I made $8 million from the black box<br class="break-800" />
when I worked at the hedge fund&hellip;</p>

<p>And now it&rsquo;s your turn at the same<br class="break-800" />
life-changing wealth.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ll be sending you your very<br class="break-800" />
own Black Box by certified mail.</p>

<p>It will come in a discreet manila package.</p>

<p>Of course, this is not an automated system that places trades for you&hellip;</p>

<p>But this box will allow you to listen for my analysis after my recommendations hit your inbox.</p>

<p>And I recommend keeping it in a safe space&hellip;</p>

<p>Because the ideas that come out of this box supplement my research and could give you the chance to <strong>earn $16,209 every seven days!</strong></p>

<p>Of course, if you prefer, you can just read my alerts.</p>

<p>Which brings me to a very important point!</p>

<h3>Bonus #3: I&rsquo;ll Send You a Brand-New Samsung Tablet, Absolutely FREE</h3>
<img class="tablet image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/AF/WSB/WSB_Black-Box_0318/WSB-Black-Box_tablet.png" />
<p>The reason is simple&hellip;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been saying how easy it is to use <strong><em>Zach&rsquo;s Weekly<br class="break-page" />
Squawk Box&hellip;</em></strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve also said how you can use this strategy ANYWHERE.</p>

<p>From the grocery store&hellip;</p>

<p>To the living room&hellip;</p>

<p>Even your children&rsquo;s soccer games.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why I purchased 1,000 portable trading tablets to GIVE AWAY today&hellip;</p>

<p>Because of a special deal I worked out with my publisher&hellip;</p>

<p>Each member who joins me today will receive a Samsung tablet.</p>

<p>This way, you always have a mobile option&hellip;</p>

<p>And can enjoy the freedom that <strong><em>Zach&rsquo;s Weekly Squawk Box</em></strong> gives you!</p>

<p>These are brand-new and factory-sealed models&hellip;</p>

<p>With the QHD screen that Samsung is famous for.</p>

<p>Heck, you&rsquo;ll spend more time watching high-definition movies on this thing than reading<br class="break-page" />
my research!</p>

<p>And this gift is yours to keep.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re free to do whatever you like with it!</p>

<p>So to recap&hellip;</p>

<h3>Here Is Everything<br class="break-400" />
You Will Get<br class="break-800" />
if You&rsquo;re Lucky Enough to Get in<br class="break-800" />
<br class="break-400" />
on This Project&hellip;</h3>

<ul class="checkmark">
  <li><strong>A New Trade Recommendation Every Week &mdash;</strong> My Income Box<br class="break-page" />
  is always scanning the market for hedge fund activity&hellip; and every week, I&rsquo;ll send you an email with my most<br class="break-639" />
  pressing research</li>
  <li><strong>My Private Weekly Phone Call &mdash;</strong> Every week, I&rsquo;ll send<br class="break-639" />

  I know</li>
  <li><strong>Regular Model Portfolio Updates &mdash;</strong> Every Monday,<br class="break-800" />
  I&rsquo;ll send through an update and my outlook on the open positions.<br class="break-639" />
  I&rsquo;ll also let you know if I think there is any action to take.</li>
</ul>

<p>Remember&hellip;</p>

<p>For access to this kind of information&hellip;</p>

<p>My former clients happily forked over a 2% management fee&hellip;</p>

<p>And gave up 20% of their gains to investment fees.</p>

<p>Those fees can easily get into <em>hundreds of thousands</em> of dollars on the low end.</p>

<p>And even if you don&rsquo;t invest&hellip;</p>

<p>Some people will pay $1,300 for a SINGLE phone call asking<br class="break-800" />
for recommendations.</p>

<p>A single call each month would cost over $15,600 a year!</p>

<p>But for folks like you&hellip;</p>

<p>You won&rsquo;t pay anywhere near those kind of fees or prices&hellip;</p>

<p>Since this is the first time ever I&rsquo;m making the Income Box available to everyday folks, I&rsquo;ve managed to negotiate a very special offer with my publisher&hellip;</p>

<p>Today only, charter memberships costs just $3,000.</p>

<p>For my weekly market analysis, a WEEKLY call, trade recommendation alerts, bonus reports, the state-of-the-art tablet and everything else I mentioned.</p>

<p>Since we are opening up the door to 1,000 members today&hellip;</p>

<p>And only 0.05% of Agora&rsquo;s readership will get in&hellip;</p>

<p>I guarantee in the next few hours, spots will fill up fast.</p>

<p>And consider this&hellip;</p>

<h3>By Next Week You Could Have Enough Money to Pay for Your Entire Subscription</h3>

<p>Like I showed you earlier&hellip;</p>

<p>Starting with just $500&hellip;</p>

<p>You could have placed a bet on Recall Studios&hellip;</p>

<p>And walked away with $6,164 in just two weeks!</p>
<img class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/AF/WSB/WSB_Black-Box_0318/WSB-BlackBox-Recall-03.png" />
<p>Or you could have placed a $500 bet on U.S. Nuclear Corp.&hellip; and walked away<br class="break-page" />
with $4,485.</p>
<img class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/AF/WSB/WSB_Black-Box_0318/WSB-BlackBox-Nuclear-03.png" />
<p>Or $3,495 from Crown Baus Capital.</p>
<img class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/AF/WSB/WSB_Black-Box_0318/WSB-BlackBox-Crown-03.png" />
<p>In each one of those trades&hellip;</p>

<p>A single $500 bet would have made you enough money to pay for your<br class="break-800" />
annual fee.</p>

<h3>And Remember&hellip; the Income Box<br class="break-800" />
Has<br class="break-639" />
the Potential to Hand You an Average Profit of $16,209 Every WEEK</h3>

<p>$3,000 is an incredible deal.</p>

<p>And this membership could be paid for by next week!</p>

<p>But I understand you&rsquo;re not familiar with the Income Box strategy&hellip;</p>

<p>After all, it&rsquo;s inspired by a system only hedge funds had access to.</p>

<p>So for that reason&hellip; to make this a no-brainer for you&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>I am going to lower the cost of admission to $2,000.</strong></p>

<p>That&rsquo;s a full $1,000 off the already incredible publishing price of $3,000.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d also like to give you a special profit guarantee.</p>

<p>You see&hellip; I&rsquo;ve shown you the power of the Income Box&hellip;</p>

<p>And how easy it is to use&hellip;</p>

<p>I want to make sure you are completely satisfied with my strategy.</p>

<p>Right now, I am going to say this&hellip;</p>

<h3>If You Don&rsquo;t Get the Opportunity to Double your Money on My Recommendations<br class="break-639" />
at Least 10 Times Over the Next Year&hellip;<br class="break-639" />
<u>I&rsquo;ll Send You a Check Worth $3,000</u></h3>

<p>That&rsquo;s correct.</p>

<p>If my recommendations don&rsquo;t deliver the opportunity to double your money<br class="break-800" />
at least 10 times this upcoming year&hellip;</p>

<p>Simply call our Baltimore-based customer care team&hellip;</p>

<p>And they will give you a $3,000 credit you can use towards another year<br class="break-800" />
of service.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s how confident I am in the Income Box.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s the only way to catch big market moves that only hedge funds could possibly<br class="break-page" />
know about.</p>

<p>Like I showed you today&hellip; you could have earned&hellip;</p>

<ul class="checkmark">
  <li>$44,850 on U.S. Nuclear Corp. in 13 days</li>
  <li>$29,375 on Petrolia Energy in seven days</li>
  <li>$7,484 on Whiting Petroleum in 11 days</li>
  <li>$10,852 on Zion Oil &amp; Gas in six days</li>
  <li>$27,941 on Weed Inc. in 21 days</li>
  <li>$16,408 on Evio Inc. in seven days</li>
  <li>$8,167 on Novavax in one day</li>
</ul>

<p>You&rsquo;ve seen the charts&hellip;</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ve seen the data&hellip;</p>

<p>The proof that hedge funds are constantly beating you to the big<br class="break-800" />
market moves&hellip;</p>

<p>And I&rsquo;ve shown you that the Income Box is the only way to help you turn the tables on that rigged game.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve lowered the price of admission to $2,000, which is only available through this<br class="break-page" />
special offer.</p>

<p>AND I&rsquo;ve added a profit guarantee that covers $3,000 as insurance.</p>

<p>Now it&rsquo;s time for a decision.</p>

<p>You could become one of the lucky 1,000 new members who will join <strong><em>Zach&rsquo;s Weekly Squawk Box.</em></strong></p>

<p>Once the 1,000-member cap is reached, we will have to shut down this offer.</p>

<p>I expect these spots to fill up fast&hellip;</p>

<p>Because with over 1.5 million readers&hellip;</p>

<p>We are only allowing 0.05% of our readers in.</p>

<p>So you better act fast&hellip; while spots are still available.</p>

<p>And keep in mind, we&rsquo;ve spent $265,000 on state-of-the-art tablets&hellip; here&rsquo;s<br class="break-800" />
a picture<br class="break-page" />
of the invoice.</p>
<img class="image_center invoice" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/AF/WSB/WSB_Black-Box_0318/WSB_BlackBox_invoice2.png" />
<p>We&rsquo;ve also spent $1.2 million investing in this project.</p>

<p>The original squawk box made me $8 million&hellip; so it was well worth<br class="break-800" />
the investment&hellip;</p>

<p>But as you can see, there is a lot of money wrapped up in this project.</p>

<p>For that reason, we simply can&rsquo;t allow refunds on this project.</p>

<p>If we did, people would get the tablet&hellip; get the opportunity the Income Box picked up&hellip;<br class="break-page" />
then cancel.</p>

<p>And that would not be fair to all of the other serious readers.</p>

<p>I realize that will probably ruffle the feathers of most people.</p>

<p>But I have a feeling you are NOT &ldquo;most people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The fact that you&rsquo;ve stuck with me this far tells me you&rsquo;re serious about taking your finances to the next level.</p>

<p>It tells me, unlike most people&hellip;</p>

<p>You are NOT content with table scraps&hellip;</p>

<p>With gains of 5&ndash;10% a year&hellip;</p>

<p>And that you&rsquo;re tired of always being left out of the BIG, life-changing moves that always seem to happen out of the blue.</p>

                        </div>

<p>If I&rsquo;m right and you are still with me&hellip;</p>

<p>I want you to get started immediately.</p>

<p>Because the Income Box just sent me an alert.</p>

<p>That means huge front trades are being made&hellip;</p>

<p>And a big payday could be right around the corner.</p>

<p>It could happen as early as tomorrow.</p>

<p>The only question is&hellip;</p>

<p>Will you get in before the big move&hellip;</p>

<p>Or will you pass this up and let someone else profit in your place?</p>

<p>Now&rsquo;s the time to level the playing field.</p>

<p>You finally have a shot at making $6,641, $14,711, even $44,850 in a matter<br class="break-800" />
